A naan is an extremely popular Indian bread, and this simple butter naan recipe allows you to make it at home using a tava, or griddle. While traditionally cooked in a tandoor, you can easily replicate the soft, fluffy texture in your own kitchen. This particular recipe uses a combination of plain flour (maida), yeast, curd, and ghee to create a flavorful dough. The use of yeast helps the naan puff up, giving it that classic light and airy texture. The addition of black sesame seeds, or kala til, gives it a nutty flavor and a beautiful visual appeal.

[INFO ]2025-09-2314:01:04.603[main]Utilities.LoggerLoad1)-Description => A masterpiece that combines the joy of a fruit salad with the classic appeal of a Bengali delicacy, the Layered Fruit Sandesh is an eye-catching dessert in which layers of sweetened and spiced paneer alternate between layers of fruits like pomegranate, kiwi, apple and pineapple.

The juiciness and naturally vibrant flavours and textures of the fruits contrast beautifully with the mild-sweetness and succulence of the Sandesh. This dainty dessert is also a pretty sight, because of the contrasting colours of the fruits and the paneer.


After arranging the ingredients in glasses, refrigerate them for an hour to allow the layers to set, and then serve immediately.

If you don't like the flavour of kewda, try other flavours like Orange Sandesh or Rose Sandesh .

We have had many requests for Karnataka recipes and hence we made this famous Karnataka nimbehannu chitranna. 

chitranna rice is a very popular South Indian recipe, which is considered very auspicious and made on festival days as an offering to God. People don’t mind standing in long queues to get their share of Karnataka chitranna rice prasad at temples. 


Owing to the ease of making it and the convenience of being a one-dish vegetarian meal, chitranna rice is a popular choice for packed South Indian lunches too. The only difference is that you can add onions when making it casually and without onions for Karnataka chitranna rice prasad. 

I would like to share some important tips, points to make the perfect chitranna rice. 1. Wash around ¾ cup of rice few times and soak with enough water for half an hour. Washing helps in removing excess starch from the rice which eventually results into non-sticky grains. 2. Add oil while cooking the rice. Oil coats the rice grain helping us to achieve separate grains on cooking. 3. I have used raw peanuts in chitranna rice. You can replace peanuts with cashew nuts or use a combination of both.

oats upma is a super healthy Indian breakfast upma recipe which is made from oats, vegetables and spices. What we love about healthy Indian oats upma is that its very easy to cook and the ingredients are easily available in the Indian kitchen.

oats upma with vegetables is far healthier than the traditional upma which is made from rava. Oats are a great source of protein for Vegetarians. It is rich in soluble fibre (to make it good for diabetics), which helps lower blood LDL cholesterol, the so-called "Bad" cholesterol.

Here, fibre-rich oats is cooked along with a traditional, flavourful tempering and scrumptious, colourful veggies like carrots and peas, which add to the flavour and visual appeal of the oats upma.


I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect quick oats upma. 1. Take care to roast the oats well, to remove the raw aroma and also ensure that the final texture of the upma is nice and not gooey. 2. Prefer to use olive oil for this recipe as it will add some omega-3 fatty acids , which reduces the inflammation in the body and prevents the onset of diseases and even avoid further damage to body due to any pre-existing disease.

The Oats Upma is quite filling, and ideal for breakfast as it will easily keep you satiated till lunch time.

Being fibre-rich, this upma can also be had by diabetics, but in that case, the sugar should be avoided.
